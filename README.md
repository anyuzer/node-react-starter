# node-react-starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anyuzer/node-react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anyuzer/node-react-starter)
A thin non-opnionated isomorphic React stack for node that does not have redux integrated. This deprecates the isomorphic-starter-kit as my stack of choice when starting a new project.

Few features:
- Koa instead of express. Has full HTTP/2 support
- Latest version of webpack/babel/react/jest/etc
- 100% test coverage
- No CSS in JS opinion (react styles by default, add your own, or don't)
- No AppState opinion (no redux)
