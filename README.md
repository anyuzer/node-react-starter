# node-react-starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anyuzer/node-react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anyuzer/node-react-starter)
A thin ES6 OOP react stack for node that is not isomorphic and does not utilize redux. Much like isomorphic-starter and service-starter, but well suited to projects that don't need isomorphic, and don't want the added integration of redux.
